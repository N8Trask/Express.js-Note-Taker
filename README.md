# Express.js-Note-Taker

## Description 

This is a note-taking application that uses express.js. Express.js is installed through node.js, and it creates API calls using HTTP methods. Some of the methods i learned are GET, POST, AND DELETE. Some of the technologies I used/learned are Express.js, Insomnia, and Heroku, which this application is deployed with.

## Usage

Navigate to Heroku through the link below. Once the page has loaded click on Get Started to bring you to the notes section. From there you will be able to add a title for the note and add text to the note body. Once you are finished with the note you can save the note and it will appear on the left-hand side. You will be able to see previous notes and browse through them from there. Click [here] to be directed to the application.
